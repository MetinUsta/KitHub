The social commentary was well handled, never controlling the narrative, appearing often through Ifemelu''s blog--first through subject lines, then through actual entries. Other appearances through conversations of Ifemelu and her friends. Always natural and appropriate to the context.   The style is worth remarking. Vivid descriptions help evoke an unfamiliar world.

January 2017   I am reading the series in order; yes, it is more fun reading this one and knowing the various back stories.
